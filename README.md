<!-- ## üåç Cloud Deployment on AWS EC2

This project is deployed using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. For production (Let's Encrypt) certbot is used to apply ssl/tls. The app is deployed on EC2 AWS. You need a valid domain configured with Route 53. Follow the next steps bellow:

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

For continuous deployment via GitHub Actions, the following GitHub secrets must be configured in your repository:

- `EC2_HOST_DNS`: Your AWS EC2 public ip.
- `EC2_USERNAME`: Your EC2 user name.
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: The SSH private key (PEM file) to connect to your EC2 instance
- `EC2_TARGET_DIR`: Your project directory in EC2
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password

You can set these in the repository by navigating to **Settings > Secrets > Actions**.

### Deployment Steps

#### Manual Deployment

First clone the github repository to ec2 instance and then go inside the project root directory in ec2. Need to create two seperate .env in frontend and backend directory.Then

1. Run init-letsencrypt to get ssl certificate from Let's Encrypt (Only one time before the deployment. Then certbot auto renews from later.)
   The script is from: article [Nginx and Let‚Äôs Encrypt with Docker in Less Than 5 Minutes](https://pentacent.medium.com/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71)

```bash
chmod +x ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

```bash
sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

```bash
docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

#### CI/CD Deployment

1. First disable the ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml workflow. (for deployment)
2. Then run the lets-encrypt-ssl.yml workflow for the first time and then diasble the workflow. (valid email and domain required which needs to be set in frontend/.env).
3. Then enable the ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml workflow again.
   Now whenever you push to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers deployment. Both the workflow run automatically when push to main branch. Thats why lets-encrypt-ssl.yml workflow only needs to be run onetime before first deployment to collect ssl certificates and then needs to be disabled. -->

## üåç Cloud Deployment on AWS EC2 with SSL/TLS using Let's Encrypt (Certbot)

This guide covers the manual deployment of your application on AWS EC2 with SSL/TLS certificates provided by Let's Encrypt using Certbot.

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

For continuous deployment via GitHub Actions, configure the following GitHub secrets in your repository:

- `EC2_HOST_DNS`: The public IP address of your AWS EC2 instance.
- `EC2_USERNAME`: The EC2 username (e.g., `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux).
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: The SSH private key (PEM file) for connecting to your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_TARGET_DIR`: The target directory on the EC2 instance where your project will reside.
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.

To add these secrets, navigate to **Settings > Secrets > Actions** in your repository.

### Deployment Steps

#### Manual Deployment

1. **Clone Repository to EC2:**
   - SSH into your EC2 instance and clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create Environment Files:**
   - Create `.env` files in both the **frontend** and **backend** directories for environment-specific configurations.

3. **Run Let's Encrypt for SSL Certificates:**
   - Run the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script to obtain the SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt (this step is only required once).
   - The script used: [Nginx and Let‚Äôs Encrypt with Docker in Less Than 5 Minutes](https://pentacent.medium.com/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71)
   - Grant execution permissions and run the script:
     ```bash
     chmod +x ./init-letsencrypt.sh
     sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
     ```

4. **Build and Start Docker Containers:**
   - Use Docker Compose to build and start your application containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build -d
     ```

#### CI/CD Deployment

1. **Disable CI/CD Workflow:**
   - Temporarily disable the `ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml` workflow to prevent automatic deployment during setup.

2. **Run Let's Encrypt Workflow:**
   - Execute the `lets-encrypt-ssl.yml` workflow to obtain SSL certificates.
   - Ensure you have a valid email and domain configured in the **frontend/.env** file.
   - After the workflow completes, disable it.

3. **Enable CI/CD Workflow:**
   - Re-enable the `ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml` workflow.
   - From this point onward, every time changes are pushed to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the application to your EC2 instance.

## üåç Cloud Deployment on AWS with Load Balancer, CloudFront, ACM, Route 53, and CI/CD

This section describes a fully automated deployment setup using **AWS EC2**, **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, **CloudFront**, **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**, **Route 53**, and **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before proceeding:

1. **AWS Account**: Access to EC2, Route 53, CloudFront, ACM, and other necessary AWS services.
2. **Valid Domain**: The domain you plan to use for your app should be managed via **Route 53**.
3. **Docker Hub Account**: Required for storing and pulling Docker images.

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

For continuous deployment via GitHub Actions, configure the following GitHub secrets in your repository:

- `EC2_HOST_DNS`: The public IP address of your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_USERNAME`: The EC2 username (e.g., `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux).
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: The SSH private key (PEM file) to connect to your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_TARGET_DIR`: The target directory on your EC2 instance where the project is located.
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.

To add these secrets, navigate to **Settings > Secrets > Actions** in your repository.

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Create EC2 Instance

- Launch an EC2 instance (e.g., Amazon Linux or Ubuntu).
- Install Docker and Docker Compose on the EC2 instance.
- Clone your repository to the EC2 instance and navigate to the project root directory.

#### 2. Set Up Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- In the **EC2 Console**, go to **Load Balancers** and create an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
- Choose **Internet-facing** and configure **HTTP/HTTPS** listeners.
- Create a **Target Group** and add your EC2 instance to it.
- Set up health checks to ensure traffic is routed only to healthy instances.

#### 3. Set Up CloudFront

- In the **CloudFront Console**, create a **Web Distribution**.
- Set the **Origin Domain Name** to the ALB DNS name.
- Enable **HTTPS** for secure communication by attaching an SSL/TLS certificate from **AWS ACM**.

#### 4. Request SSL/TLS Certificate in ACM

- In **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**, request an SSL certificate for your domain.
- Verify domain ownership by adding the required DNS records in **Route 53**.
- Attach the certificate to the CloudFront distribution for secure HTTPS connections.

#### 5. Configure Route 53

- In **Route 53**, create a new **A record** to route traffic to CloudFront.
- Set the **Alias** to point to your CloudFront distribution's DNS name.

#### 6. CI/CD Deployment

- Enable the `ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml` workflow to trigger automatic deployments when pushing changes to the main branch. There is no need for the `lets-encrypt-ssl.yml` workflow in this setup.

#### 7. Test the Deployment

- After the setup is complete, visit your domain to verify that traffic is routed correctly through CloudFront, the Load Balancer, and your EC2 instance.

---

This setup ensures a secure, scalable, and automated deployment pipeline for your application on AWS. With CloudFront and ACM, you can deliver content securely with SSL/TLS, while Route 53 routes traffic to your CloudFront distribution, providing a robust infrastructure for production environments.
