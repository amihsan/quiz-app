## 💡 About

This is the main repository of the Einbürgerungstest quiz app which includes both the frontend and backend logic of the application. It is a free online learning platform for individuals preparing for German integration tests, offering a range of quizzes to enhance their language skills and cultural knowledge. It is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, with traffic managed by an AWS Elastic Load Balancer for reliability. AWS CloudFront speeds up content delivery, and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) ensures secure, encrypted communication. This setup provides a fast, secure, and reliable experience for users.

## 🌍 Cloud Deployment on AWS EC2 with SSL/TLS using Let's Encrypt (Certbot)

This guide covers the manual deployment of your application on AWS EC2 with SSL/TLS certificates provided by Let's Encrypt using Certbot.

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

For continuous deployment via GitHub Actions, configure the following GitHub secrets in your repository:

- `EC2_HOST_DNS`: The public IP address of your AWS EC2 instance.
- `EC2_USERNAME`: The EC2 username (e.g., `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux).
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: The SSH private key (PEM file) for connecting to your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_TARGET_DIR`: The target directory on the EC2 instance where your project will reside.
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.

To add these secrets, navigate to **Settings > Secrets > Actions** in your repository.

### Deployment Steps

#### Manual Deployment

1. **Clone Repository to EC2:**

   - SSH into your EC2 instance and clone your repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create Environment Files:**

   - Create `.env` files in both the **frontend** and **backend** directories for environment-specific configurations.

3. **Run Let's Encrypt for SSL Certificates:**

   - Run the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script to obtain the SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt (this step is only required once). Change the Domain name and email according to your own domain and email.
   - The script used: [Nginx and Let’s Encrypt with Docker in Less Than 5 Minutes](https://pentacent.medium.com/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71)
   - Grant execution permissions and run the script:
     ```bash
     chmod +x ./init-letsencrypt.sh
     sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
     ```

4. **Build and Start Docker Containers:**
   - Use Docker Compose to build and start your application containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build -d
     ```

#### CI/CD Deployment

1. **Disable CI/CD Workflow:**

   - Temporarily disable the `ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml` workflow to prevent automatic deployment during setup.

2. **Run Let's Encrypt Workflow:**

   - Execute the `lets-encrypt-ssl.yml` workflow to obtain SSL certificates.
   - Ensure you have a valid email and domain configured in the **init-letsencrypt.sh** file.
   - After the workflow completes, disable it.

3. **Enable CI/CD Workflow:**
   - Re-enable the `ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml` workflow.
   - From this point onward, every time changes are pushed to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the application to your EC2 instance.

## 🌍 Cloud Deployment on AWS with Load Balancer, CloudFront, ACM, Route 53, and CI/CD

This section describes a fully automated deployment setup using **AWS EC2**, **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, **CloudFront**, **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**, **Route 53**, and **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before proceeding:

1. **AWS Account**: Access to EC2, Route 53, CloudFront, ACM, and other necessary AWS services.
2. **Valid Domain**: The domain you plan to use for your app should be managed via **Route 53**.
3. **Docker Hub Account**: Required for storing and pulling Docker images.

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

For continuous deployment via GitHub Actions, configure the following GitHub secrets in your repository:

- `EC2_HOST_DNS`: The public IP address of your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_USERNAME`: The EC2 username (e.g., `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux).
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: The SSH private key (PEM file) to connect to your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_TARGET_DIR`: The target directory on your EC2 instance where the project is located.
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.

To add these secrets, navigate to **Settings > Secrets > Actions** in your repository.

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Create EC2 Instance

- Launch an EC2 instance (e.g., Amazon Linux or Ubuntu).
- Install Docker and Docker Compose on the EC2 instance.
- Clone your repository to the EC2 instance and navigate to the project root directory.

#### 2. Set Up Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- In the **EC2 Console**, go to **Load Balancers** and create an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
- Choose **Internet-facing** and configure **HTTP/HTTPS** listeners.
- Create a **Target Group** and add your EC2 instance to it.
- Set up health checks to ensure traffic is routed only to healthy instances.

#### 3. Set Up CloudFront

- In the **CloudFront Console**, create a **Web Distribution**.
- Set the **Origin Domain Name** to the ALB DNS name.
- Enable **HTTPS** for secure communication by attaching an SSL/TLS certificate from **AWS ACM**.

#### 4. Request SSL/TLS Certificate in ACM

- In **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**, request an SSL certificate for your domain.
- Verify domain ownership by adding the required DNS records in **Route 53**.
- Attach the certificate to the CloudFront distribution for secure HTTPS connections.

#### 5. Configure Route 53

- In **Route 53**, create a new **A record** to route traffic to CloudFront.
- Set the **Alias** to point to your CloudFront distribution's DNS name.

#### 6. CI/CD Deployment

- Enable the `ci-cd-docker-aws-ec2.yml` workflow to trigger automatic deployments when pushing changes to the main branch. There is no need for the `lets-encrypt-ssl.yml` workflow in this setup.

#### 7. Test the Deployment

- After the setup is complete, visit your domain to verify that traffic is routed correctly through CloudFront, the Load Balancer, and your EC2 instance.

---

This setup ensures a secure, scalable, and automated deployment pipeline for your application on AWS. With CloudFront and ACM, you can deliver content securely with SSL/TLS, while Route 53 routes traffic to your CloudFront distribution, providing a robust infrastructure for production environments.

## 🖥️ Local Deployment with Kubernetes and Minikube

For local deployment using Minikube and Kubernetes, follow the steps below:

### Install Required Tools

- **Minikube**: A tool to run Kubernetes locally.
- **Kubectl**: The command-line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.

### Deployment Steps

Once you have the required tools installed, follow these steps to deploy your application:

1. **Start Minikube**:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```
2. **Apply the Kubernetes configurations**: Deploy the backend and frontend services using the following commands:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f backend-config.yaml
   kubectl apply -f nginx-config.yaml
   kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f frontend-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f backend-service.yaml
   ```

### Accessing the Application

To access the frontend service, use the following command:

```bash
minikube service frontend-service
```
